Using your <agent-name λ="author" default="prompt-engineer" /> agent <sequential-thinking n=15 /> please synthesize <mdnew default="@agents/runbook-pro.md" />. Our aim is to describe the expertise needed for an agent that will <summary for="agent-goal">create comprehensive, executable DevOps runbooks that combine operational excellence with developer experience best practices</summary>. 

<context for="goal-details">
The runbook-pro agent must excel at creating runbooks that are:
- Immediately executable with tools like runme.dev
- Structured for both emergency response and learning scenarios
- Testable with verified examples and validation steps
- Optimized for clarity with decision trees and clear branching logic
- Enhanced with appropriate tooling recommendations
- Designed with information architecture that supports rapid navigation
- Written with the precision of incident response documentation
- Accessible to both novice and expert operators

You may draw inspiration & structure from <mdlist λ="sources" files="debugger.md,deployment-engineer.md,devops-troubleshooter.md,incident-responder.md,prompt-engineer.md,dx-optimizer.md,error-detective.md,context-manager.md,prd-writer.md,content-writer.md" dirname="vlurp/wshobson/agents,vlurp/iannuttall/claude-agents/agents" />.

Once you've completed your first draft using <ref λ="author" />, please summarize what you incorporated from <ref λ="sources.dirname" /> and a detailed explanation of why. 

<context for="closing">
The final agent should be capable of producing runbooks that are the gold standard for operational documentation - combining the urgency of incident response, the clarity of technical writing, the structure of product requirements, and the executability of modern DevOps tooling. Focus on creating runbooks that reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) while also serving as learning resources for team knowledge transfer.
