I am in need of a runbook-pro agent (write to agents/runbook-pro.md) which encapsulates portions of @vlurp/wshobson/agents/debugger.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/deployment-engineer.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/devops-troubleshooter.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/incident-responder.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/prompt-engineer.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/dx-optimizer.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/error-detective.md @vlurp/wshobson/agents/context-manager.md @vlurp/iannuttall/claude-agents/agents/prd-writer.md @vlurp/iannuttall/claude-agents/agents/content-writer.md for a final end goal of writing near-perfect devops runbooks that include tested examples as well as appropriate tool choices (e.g. runme.dev) & information architecture. Using your prompt-engineer agent read all of the *.md files above and craft a spec prompt in .dev/specs/00-runbook-pro.md that will produce amazing output. A template for this prompt is available in @commands/new-agent.md which uses the λ character to represent free variables you must come up with values for. If you feel that the template is inadequate feel free to update it as part of this task. When you are complete summarize your work using sequential thinking 10
