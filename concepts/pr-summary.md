Give me a PR summary with checkboxes, grouped by logical change. Use colons for the main point, then bullet the implementation details. Keep it technical and direct - no fluff.

1. Checkboxes for major changes
2. Bold headers with brief "why" after the colon
3. Implementation details as sub-bullets
4. No intro/outro sentences
5. Technical terms without explanation
6. Present tense, active voice
