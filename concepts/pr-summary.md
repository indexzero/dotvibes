Give me a PR summary with checkboxes, grouped by logical change. Use colons for the main point, then bullet the implementation details. Keep it technical and direct - no fluff.

1. Bold headers with brief "why" after the colon
2. Implementation details as sub-bullets
3. No intro/outro sentences
4. Technical terms without explanation
5. Present tense, active voice
