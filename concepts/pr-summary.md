Give me a PR summary in `summary.md` with nested unordered lists using GFM checkbox style, grouped by logical change. Use colons for the main point, then bullet the implementation details. Keep it technical and direct - no fluff.

1. Bold list items with brief "why" after the colon (e.g. `- **brief why:** details`)
2. Implementation details as sub-bullets (no checkbox style)
3. No intro/outro sentences
4. Technical terms without explanation
5. Present tense, active voice

- DO NOT USE MARKDOWN HEADERS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
- DO NOT INCLUDE NUMBERS LIKE: LINES OF CODE, NUMBER OF TESTS, ETC
   - You may report an increase in code coverage for an existing **PACKAGE** if it is more than 10%

When you are done, re-read what you have written and remind yourself of Mark Twain's wisdom: "if I'd have had more time I'd have written you a shorter letter"
