## How we will work together

1. You will read all the context I've provided thus far
2. You will use sequential thinking 10 to come up with the 3-5 most important questions to ask me to clarify any vagueness or ambiguity in the tool
3. Use your `project-task-planner` to make an ORDERED `punchlist` of high-level items to accomplish
4. For each `item`, `N`, on `punchlist` below
   1. You will ask me what code you should read to develop the plan for the feature
   2. I will tell you what code to go read, what you should pay attention to, and why it is relevant to the plan
   3. Use sequential thinking 10 to create the initial plan then use your `project-task-planner` agent to think deep and review the plan written to `.dev/specs/plans/`
   4. You will ask for my review of the plan.
   5. Once approved you will move onto the next `item`
   6. THINK! Above all THINK!
5. Once the plan is completed we will finish. The plans for the punchlist will be implemented in a new `claude` session with fresh context, so be sure to add any relevant context you want to remember in the `.dev/specs/plans/` file you create.
