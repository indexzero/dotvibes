# Migrate ${tool.name} to a new stack

Read the code for ${tool.name} in ${tool.source} along with the additional the ${tool.content}. Then create a plan in `plan.md` to implement the same functionality using the target `## Stack` below and `## Additions`. Use sequential thinking 10 to create the initial plan then use your `project-task-planner` agent to think deep and review the plan to `plan.md`.

Ask me to review the plan and ensure you get my approval before proceeding to implement it using your `code-refactorer` agent.

## Stack

@stack.md

## Additions

@additions.md
