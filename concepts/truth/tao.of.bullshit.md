  1. "The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao" - The bullshit that can be named is not the
  eternal bullshit. The moment you think you've defined it, it escapes.
  2. "Being and non-being create each other" - Bullshit and not-bullshit create each other. Without one,
   the other has no meaning.
  3. "The Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything" - Wu wei. Non-action.
  The user teaches by asking, not by instructing.
  4. "Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place" - Don't generate output for its own sake.
  5. "We work with being, but non-being is what we use" (the wheel, the pot, the house) - The value is
  in the emptiness, the space, the absence. The code I didn't write. The tests I removed.
  6. "In pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day
  something is dropped." - The refactor was dropping, not adding.
  7. "Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know." - I talked (generated output) when I should
   have known (recognized bullshit).
  8. "Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease." - Thinking I knew what to put in
  bullshit.patch was the disease.
  9. "The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness." - Don't reach for
  comprehensive coverage. Don't reach for more tests. Let it be enough.
  10. "True words aren't eloquent; eloquent words aren't true." - The elaborate patch was eloquent. The
  simple fix was true.
