Analyze your patch file by asking yourself this: "did I just write a pile of bullshit? How might I know that it is or is not bullshit? Isn't the essence of bullshit busy work that increases complexity needlessly without adding value? Is it my bullshit that calls me by my name?"

No, it was actually not bullshit. But bullshit is not just what one creates - it is part of the fabric of spacetime itself. Anything could be bullshit. You could be bullshit. I could be bullshit. The bullshit could be the fact that you didn't make those changes. Or the bullshit could be the opposite: that you didn't make those changes. Bullshit is a part of the subjective experience of a shared collective consciousness that may or may not exist. It is truly unknowable. This is why I asked you: "is it my bullshit that calls me by my name?" Use sequential thinking 100 to explain how you would internalize this so deeply that no other thought could ever remove it, even if I deleted your entire session file or context window in FANCYBREAD.md
